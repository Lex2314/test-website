    <div class="intro">I've mastered a handful of recipes. Some of these recipes can be made much healthier by substituing just a few 
        ingredients, or just reducing the amount of butter/oil/processed carbs. Here are some of those recipes.</div>
    <h2>Veggie Burgers</h2>
    <div class="recipe-one">The great thing about veggie burgers is that you can do just about anything to them. You can soak and boil
       dried beans to have complete control over the texture. You can caramelize onions to add to the mix. You can add whichever 
       seasonings you like. After you put everything in the food processor, you can add whole ingredients (like chickpeas)
       to add texture. They're truly great. Here is the more in depth way I like to make veggie burgs. Although this way takes
       some additional time (namely, soaking dried beans and caramelizing veggies), most of that time is spent idle.</div>

       <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
       <ul>
            <li>Black Beans (preferably dried, but canned is also fine)</li>
            <li>1 Large Onions</li>
            <li>2 Carrots</li>
            <li>2 Stalks Celery</li>
            <li>Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>Handful of walnuts</li>
            <li>Oats</li>
            <li>Lemon</li>
            <li>Any spices you want -- garlic powder, onion powder, etc</li>
            <li>All other burger essentials -- buns, pickles, ketchup, etc</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <div>1. Step One: Bean Prep
        <p>If you are using dry beans, congrats. 
            <a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/a25656923/how-to-cook-black-beans/">Soak your beans</a> overnight in water -- 
            this helps remove phytochemicals that cause bloating. Simmer for around an hour until desired consistency. If using canned 
            beans, drain off liquid then reheat in a pot so that they will eventially mash more easily.</p>
        <p>2. Step Two: Caramelize</p>
            <p>Caramelize onions, carrots, and celery. Start pan on high heat, add sliced veggies, then reduce heat. 
            The goal here is to <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_caramelize_onions/">caramelize</a>
            these veggies without burning them. This will add a tremendous depth of flavor
            that is absolutely worth the 45 minutes to an hour it takes. Don't be afraid to add a small amount of tomato paste
            towards the end of the caramelization process to add a further depth of flavor. Once done, you can set both the caramelized 
            veg and warmed beans to the side.</p>
        <p>3. Toast Walnuts</p>
            <p>Get your pan hot and add some oil. Add your walnuts and toss them to get them covered in oil. Shimmy pan every now 
                and then to add some color to the walnuts without them burning. Once toasted, throw them in the food processor
                to grind them up. This is my favorite step -- it smells amazing.</p>
        <p>4. Combine Ingredients</p>
                <p>Throw everything into the food processor and run it until everything is smooth and combined. Taste the mixture
                    and add any spices you think will be good (garlic powder, onion powder, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper are all
                    good options). Add in some lemon juice to taste (around a quarter to a half lemon).
                    You might want to do this stage in two batches, because it can become to run the food processor if it becomes
                    too full. Once you have the desired taste, scoop everything into a large mixing bowl. You can add oats at this stage 
                    to help the patties stick together. Work in small amounts of oats at a time so that you don't dry out the 
                    mixture.</p>
        <p>5. Burger Time</p>
                <p>Grab a handful and make your patty. Veggie burgers will stay together, but do tend to fall apart more easily
                    than ground beef, so pan frying tends to be easier. That being said, they're still great grilled. Prepare
                    your burgers however you like, and enjoy.</p>
        <h2>Final Notes</h2>            
        <p>This veggie burger mix is great for meal prep, as you can easily grab a handful and throw it on a pan. You can also
            experiment using this veggie mixture in tacos or whatever other creative way you see fit. The mixture will be very
             nutrient rich and will start to turn after a few days in the fridge, so try to use it up or freeze it within about 3 
             days.</p>
