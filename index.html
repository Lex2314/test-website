    <div class="intro">I've mastered a handful of recipes. Some of these recipes can be made much healthier by substituing just a few 
        ingredients, or just reducing the amount of butter/oil/processed carbs. Here are some of those recipes.</div>
    <h2>Veggie Burgers</h2>
    <div class="recipe-one">The great thing about veggie burgers is that you can do just about anything to them. You can soak and boil
       dried beans to have complete control over the texture. You can caramelize onions to add to the mix. You can add whichever 
       seasonings you like. After you put everything in the food processor, you can add whole ingredients (like chickpeas)
       to add texture. They're truly great. Here is the more in depth way I like to make veggie burgs. Although this way takes
       some additional time (namely, soaking dried beans and caramelizing veggies), most of that time is spent idle.</div>
